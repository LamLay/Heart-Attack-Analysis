# Heart-Attack-Analysis
This is my analysis for the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

In this study, I used the following statistical methods to determine which factors are the most important in detecting heart disease based on the dataset:
+ Hypothesis Testing
+ Chi-square test of independence
+ Z-test
+ T-test
+ F-test
+ Goodness-of-fit test

This study was conducted as the final project for the EXST 7005 course by Dr. Thanos Gentimis from Louisiana State University.
